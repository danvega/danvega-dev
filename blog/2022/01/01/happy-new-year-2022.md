Happy New Year! I want to take a few minutes and reflect on the year that was 2021 and look ahead to 2022.

## 2021

### Briebug

I started a new job this year at [Briebug Software](https://briebug.com/) as an Enterprise Architect. We are a consultancy and I spent this year working for a single client who happens to be a Fortune 50 company. The size of the company and the volume at which the applications run presented all sorts of new challenges for me. I got to work on a bunch of really cool projects running Spring Boot & Spring Cloud. Towards the end of the year, I was promoted to Principal Architect and can’t say enough good things about Briebug!

### SpringOne

This year I was lucky to be selected as one of the speakers at SpringOne. I have attended a few Spring Conferences before and it is easily one of my favorites so this was a big deal and an honor for me. [My Presentation](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2021/08/30/spring-one-2021/) was on Full Stack Java Development with Spring Boot and Vue. I thought I did a really good job of preparing for this talk but nothing really prepares you for Zoom dropping off in the middle of your presentation. Thankfully I was alerted that it happened and I was able to log back in and finish the talk. I got some really good feedback on my talk and appreciate anyone who joined us live or watched [the replay](https://springone.io/2021/sessions/full-stack-development-with-spring-boot-vuejs).

### Creating Content

I love creating content and thankfully I was able to get back to it this year. Here are a few of my favorite pieces of content that I worked on this year.

**Blog**

- [Full Stack Java Development with Spring Boot and VueJS](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2021/01/22/full-stack-java-vue/)
- [14” MacBook Pro M1 Max Review](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2021/11/15/macbook-pro-m1-max-review/)

**YouTube**

## 2022

### Goals

Now that I have 2 small kids at home I’m hesitant to put specific goals out in the world because I honestly don’t know If I can complete them. With that said here are some aspirations.

**Move my website over to Nuxt 3**

Nuxt 3 is now in beta and I have had some fun learning it over the last few weeks. There are still some features that aren’t available that I will need to completely move my site over but I am not in a huge rush.

**Content**

I was happy to be back at turning out content last year but after looking at my total numbers I know I can do better. I’m setting some lofty goals in this department but I think they are doable.

- Blog: 1 post per month for a total of 12 posts
- YouTube: 1 video per week for a total of 52 videos
- Live Streaming: 2x a month for a total of 24 live streams
- Courses: 2 New Courses

**Read more books**

Whenever a read a new book I always end up asking myself, why don’t I do this more often. I read a few books towards the end of the year and it reminded me what I was missing. I am going to set a goal of reading 1 book per month for a total of 12 books in 2022.

**Conferences**

I’m really hoping that we return to somewhat of a normal conference season where we are all hanging out in person. I would love to speak at 4+ conferences this year and to do that I need to submit to a bunch of conferences. I need to get better and finding the conferences I want to speak at writing good abstracts. I keep all of my call for papers in a [Github repo](https://github.com/danvega/call-for-papers) if you’re interested in reading them.

**Newsletter**

I’m really happy that I got back to producing my newsletter on a weekly basis. I would like to continue that in 2022. I’m constantly looking at making small tweaks to my format and that is something I will continue to do. If you’re a subscriber and have a suggestions please send them my way. If you’re not a subscriber, [what are you waiting for](https://www.danvega.dev/newsletter/).

**Java Champions**

[Java Champions](https://developer.oracle.com/javachampions/) are leaders in the Java community who are experts at what they do. I happen to know a few Java Champions and I look up to them and aspire to be like them. I feel like I do a lot for the Java community but I could be doing so much more. I am going to figure out more ways to contribute to the community who has given me so much so that one day I might join this list.

**Charity**

Due to the pandemic the non profit organization I run has been unable to throw our big event, [Toys for Shots](https://toysforshots.com/). This is something I hope we can back to this year. With that I would like to move our website over to Nuxt 3. I also want to build in some stripe integration so that we can take donations online which is one feature we are lacking. CLE Cares, is the name of our non-profit and we need to get a site setup for that. A lot of work to do here but it’s something I enjoy working on so I look forward to it.

## Conclusion

I know it sounds silly but I look forward to the new year after the long holiday season. I’m excited for what this year will bring. I’m looking forward to doing more of what I love to do, learning and creating content. Thank you to all of you who continue to support me and I hope you have a happy and healthy 2022.
