I feel very lucky that I get to work with so many different programming languages & frameworks on a day to day basis. This wouldn't be as much fun if I had to bounce around using different IDE's, editors and tools.

Thankfully we have a tool like Visual Studio Code that has support for so many languages, frameworks, and a really great extension ecosystem. It is because of this I can switch between languages like Java, C# and Go or Frameworks like Spring Boot, .NET and Java and still be productive.

I mentioned to someone that I was creating Spring Boot Applications in Visual Studio Code and the reaction was "You can do that?". With that, I decided to put together a tutorial on how to create a Spring Boot Application in Visual Studio Code.

Assuming you already have VS Code installed, you're probably wondering "What extensions do I need to install?"

## Visual Studio Code Extension Packs

I don't know if a lot of people know about this, but there are some really good extensions for Visual Studio Code if you're a Java developer.

The problem with getting up and running with a new language or framework is that there can be a lot of extensions that you need to install. Fortunately for us, there is a feature in VS Code called extension packs. This allows a single extension, the extension pack, to group multiple extensions into one. Instead of asking you to go out and install 10 extensions, you just need to install these two.

## Spring Boot in Visual Studio Code Tutorial

With Visual Studio Code and the proper extensions installed you are ready to create a new Spring Boot Application. In this tutorial, you will create a Spring Boot REST API and then a simple Vue application that talks to it.
