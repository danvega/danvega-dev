      <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Dan Vega.</h1>
      <img src="../assets/img/dv-headshot.jpg" alt="Dan Vega" class="headshot" />
      <p>
        I am a Software Engineer living just outside of one of my favorite
        places in the world, Cleveland, Ohio. I am a self-taught programmer who
        firmly believes that you can accomplish anything in this life if you put
        your mind to it, roll up your sleeves and are willing to put in the
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been writing software for over 20+ years now and I use my
        knowledge, passion, and influence to help other developers achieve their
        goals. I teach online and currently, have over 160,000 students.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my personal life I am a husband to my best friend in the world and a
        father of two little girls. I enjoy reading, running and lifting weights
        to get me through the week.
      </p>
      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My journey to becoming a computer programmer did not start at a fancy university. Thanks to my mom, who made me
        take a typing class in high school, in which I excelled, I became interested in computers. After high school, I
        worked as a landscaper. One day, I decided that this was not life for me. I chose to enroll at a local college for
        a programming certification in Applied Computer Sciences. Once I completed this certification, I did some
        freelancing to hone my skills, and soon after, I landed my first job at a startup in San Francisco! It was
        difficult leaving my friends and family, but I was so excited about this opportunity and quickly packed my bags
        for the West Coast.
      </p>
      <p>
        My educational journey did not stop there. I consider myself a lifelong learner. Having a passion for learning is
        the secret to success in life. While I was living in California, I hired a teaching assistant from UC Berkeley to
        tutor me in computer programming. I spent most of my nights far from home immersing myself in Java programming
        books to advance my skills, which certainly paid off!
      </p>
      <p>
        After two years in San Francisco, I landed a new position back in Cleveland and jumped at the opportunity to move
        back home. I continued to advance to different positions and companies over the years, and here I am, 20+ years
        later, still loving to code every single day.
      </p>

      <h2>One thing that has always stuck with me</h2>
      <p>
        One thing that has always stuck with me over the years is how grateful I am for all of the people who taught and
        inspired me. This helped inspire me to share my passion for learning with others. When I discovered online
        teaching, I knew this was my calling to help other people make positive changes in their lives through education.
        As I said in the beginning, if you are willing to put in the work, you can accomplish anything in this life. If
        programming is what you are hoping to learn and work hard on, I am happy to show you the way!
      </p>

      <h2>Some other facts about me</h2>
      <p>
        I live just outside of Cleveland, Ohio with my wife Jen, and our 2 daughters Isabella and Juliana. When not
        spending time with my family, I love reading books, listening to podcasts, and watching online courses. I have a
        real thirst for knowledge and it consumes me every day of the week. I also love to run and lift heavy weights,
        which keeps me balanced throughout the week.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also the president of a nonprofit organization here in Northeast Ohio called CLE Cares. Our mission is to
        help as many people as we can in the area and give back to a place that we hold near and dear to our hearts. I
        also love to speak at user group meetings and conferences around the country. If you are interested in having me
        speak at your event, please contact me.
      </p>
