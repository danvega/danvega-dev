Happy Monday and welcome to the last edition of the newsletter in 2022. I‚Äôm sure we say this every single year but it‚Äôs really hard to believe that another year is almost behind us. Before we get to the good stuff I want to take this opportunity to thank you. This has been one of the best professional years of my career and I owe a lot of that to the support that you have given to me. I hope you and your family have a Happy Holiday and a wonderful time ringing in the new year.

I am working a few days this week and then I am out until the new year. During that time I hope to work on my end-of-the-year reflections as well as goals / what I want to focus on in the new year. In today‚Äôs newsletter, I want to talk to you about the workshop I am currently working on, new content, and some travel plans for 2023.

## Getting Started with Spring Workshop

I‚Äôm currently working on a workshop that I will be delivering the 2nd week of January at CodeMash. I have talked about this before but this will be a 4-hour workshop which I think is the longest live presentation I have ever given. I have created a few 12-14 hour courses but those are totally different animals. DaShaun and I had another [Spring Office Hours](https://youtu.be/Rx-qq3likgM) last week where we discussed our plans for the workshop.

In this episode, we had a chance to talk about the application we are going to build in the workshop which is called Runnerz. We both love to run and needed a domain to speak on so we figured this would be perfect. We had a chance to discuss what part of the domain model we would cover without getting too far into it and off-topic.

I also had a chance to really start diving into each of the sections that I am going to deliver and come up with a plan. The first section I went through was the core fundamentals and features of Spring & Spring Boot. I want to keep this section around an hour long so I had to be selective with what I wanted to teach and this is what I settled on:

- Core Fundamentals & Features
  - Structuring your code
  - Spring IoC Container / Application Context
  - Spring Beans
  - Dependency Injection
  - Configuration
  - Profiles
  - Actuator
  - Logging
  - DevTools

I have a video on [Dependency Injection](https://youtu.be/aX-bgylmprA) that comes in at 30 minutes so even getting through this list is going to be a challenge. This week I will be doing some dry runs of each of my sections and getting everything ready to go. When I get back from break I only have a week to have this workshop and my talk on GraphQL polished up and ready to go. I‚Äôm beyond excited about CodeMash and I hope to see some of you there!

## Presentations in 2023

I have spent a lot of time lately identifying what conferences, meetups, or anyone that will have me present next year. This involved going through past conferences as well as asking my friends on the bird app for some resources on upcoming conferences. I have also spent a lot of time working on abstracts of topics that I am interested in focusing on next year.

I‚Äôm happy to announce that some of that hard work has already paid off I have been accepted to speak at Devnexus in Atlanta. I will be presenting with my friend Nate Schutta on [Spring Recipes - A collection of common sense solutions](https://devnexus.com/presentations/spring-recipes-a-collection-of-common-sense-solutions). We gave this talk to KCDC last year but we are working on a major update so even if you had a chance to see this talk please consider checking it out as it will be different.

I was also excited to find out that DaShaun and I will be traveling to San Francisco in January for an event. We will be talking about Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3. I actually have 3 talks so far in January on the same subject so it‚Äôs going to be a fun month talking to everyone about the next generation of The Spring Framework.

### üéôÔ∏èUpcoming Talks

- [CodeMash 2023](https://www.codemash.org/): Give your APIs a REST & Make the move to GraphQL
- [CodeMash 2023](https://www.codemash.org/): Getting Started with Spring
- [Devnexus 2023](https://devnexus.com/presentations/spring-recipes-a-collection-of-common-sense-solutions): Spring Recipes - A collection of common-sense solutions

### **üé¨ My New Videos**

[IntelliJ Postfix](https://youtube.com/shorts/wOYTJLQ0xNM?feature=share) - Learn about a quick tip in IntelliJ called postfix autocompletion. This postfix allows you to create a new variable from a statement in Java.

[Google reCaptcha + Spring Security](https://youtu.be/dyA_Pbtbn_E) - In this tutorial, you will learn how to integrate Google reCaptcha v3 in a Spring Boot application using Spring Security. If you want to learn how to create your own Spring Security Filter and write custom code to integrate with a third-party service like Google reCaptcha this is the tutorial for you.

[Spring Security JWT Client](https://youtu.be/6kFzJZCW1Qw) - I have created a bunch of tutorials lately on Spring Security and the feedback has been amazing. The one suggestion I kept hearing was that you wanted to see how a front-end (client) would use the Spring Security JWT authentication. In this tutorial, I created a client from scratch using Vite + Vue 3.

[Response Entity](https://youtu.be/B5Zrn1Tzyqw) - In this tutorial, I discuss what the `ResponseEntity` class is in Spring and when you might want to reach for it. This is in response to code samples that I have seen lately that automatically use the response entity as the return type when there was no manipulation of the response headers or status.

[Spring Office Hours Episode 23](https://youtu.be/Rx-qq3likgM) - In this episode DaShaun and I discussed the plans for the upcoming workshop ‚ÄúGetting Started with Spring‚Äù. We had a great discussion about the domain of the application we are building for the workshop.

## üåé¬†Around the web

As I hinted at in an earlier newsletter I am going to change the format of this section a bit. Part of my anxiety in putting this newsletter together is making sure I have enough links to interesting things around the web. Going forward I am going to share a few items but give a little more commentary on each. If I don‚Äôt happen to come across anything interesting this section will be empty ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I am drawing this inspiration from [Ali Abdaal‚Äôs Sunday Snippets Newsletter](https://aliabdaal.com/newsletter/) which I am a huge fan of. As always your feedback is welcome.

### üë®‚Äçüíª¬†Projects

[Just](https://just.maciejwalkowiak.com/) is a command-line tool for developing Spring Boot applications by [Maciej Walkowiak](https://twitter.com/maciejwalkowiak). While I haven‚Äôt had a chance to give this a try myself the video he made is amazing. This tool will give you single commands like `just run` which will run your application regardless of what build tool you‚Äôre using and offers live reloading. I‚Äôm not doing it justice here and you need to head over to the website (which is beautiful by the way) and check out everything Just has to offer.

### üê¶¬†Tweets

There are rumors going around that the crazy spaceman wants to increase the character limit from 280 to 4000. This tweet was a great visual representation of what that change would mean. I‚Äôm not a big fan of this because it would require way more time to scroll through information ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### ‚úçÔ∏è Quote of the week

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stop when you‚Äôre tired, stop when you‚Äôre done.‚Äù - [@davidgoggins](https://twitter.com/davidgoggins)

I have consumed a lot of content from David over the past month and wow what an interesting human being. I need to pick up his book but I also have a whole bookshelf full of books I want to read ü§î

## Until Next Week

I hope you enjoyed this installment of the newsletter and I will talk to you in the next one. If you have any links you would like me to include please [contact me](http://twitter.com/therealdanvega) and I might add them to a future newsletter. I hope you have a great week and as always friends...

Happy Coding<br/>
