Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. In today‚Äôs newsletter, I want to talk to you about the newest release of Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3. I also want to spend a little time talking to you about a 4-hour workshop I‚Äôm working on for CodeMash on Getting Started with Spring.

## Spring Boot 3

In case you have been living under a rock Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 have been released. I have spent some time over the last couple of months really trying to understand everything that has gone into this release.

While I still have a lot to learn I feel like I have a good handle on the key features of these releases. Last week (alongside my colleagues Nate and DaShaun) I gave a presentation internally to a large group of coworkers about what is new in Spring Boot 3. I thought it was a great high-level discussion about what we were excited about in the next generation of Spring.

A lot of the questions we received were about what customers would need to do to Upgrade from 2.x to 3.0. I think the biggest advice we had in this area was to make the upgrade incrementally. If you aren't already on 2.7.x try and make this upgrade first. The latest 2.7 versions support Java 17 so make the move to Java 17 in that version if possible. Once you are there it‚Äôs a much smoother process to get to 3. Finally, there is a really great [migration guide](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Migration-Guide) that you can go through that will help you with this process.

I have been building a tutorial that would show off a lot of these features in a video tutorial for a few weeks now. I was finally able to record and edit this video that ended up coming in at 1 hour and 10 minutes. In this tutorial, I will walk you through some of the major features in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot as well as some of my favorite features that are flying in under the radar.

## Getting Started with Spring Workshop

[DaShaun](https://twitter.com/dashaun) and I are building a workshop for [CodeMash](https://www.codemash.org/session-details/?id=380331) and we thought we would discuss our plan for the 4-hour workshop on the latest episode of [Spring Office Hours](https://youtu.be/OtaQZij3emQ). We broke down the agenda we came up for the workshop and discussed some of the decisions we had to make.

I think when you hear 4 hours you generally think that is a long time to learn something. The problem with that thinking is that Spring is large and there is a lot to cover. When you‚Äôre doing an in person workshop you also have to take into account helping attendees work through any issues and built-in breaks every hour or so.

We had to end up cutting testing, security and some of details in the Spring to Production section. With that said I am really happy with our initial outline. We are going to work through our presentation over the next few weeks and this will probably changed based on our dry runs but its a great start. If you‚Äôre interested in what we came up with you can check out the agenda in the GitHub repository below that will be changing over the next month.
