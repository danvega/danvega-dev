Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega. This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

This week I started a discussion on dev.to called "[What is your conference walk up song](https://dev.to/therealdanvega/what-is-your-conference-talk-walkup-song-36kb)". I thought it was an interesting idea and if you have a chance I would love to hear what yours would be. Other than that I don't have any new articles to share with you but I do have some pretty exciting news. I have some very cool projects in the works that should help get my writing in front of more people which should lead to helping out a lot more people.

I told you that I got accepted to freeCodeCamp last week. This week I also had a really good meeting with someone who I instantly clicked with in the Vue community. I am going to be working on some content with him and I sent out this cryptic tweet to let everyone know what I was working on. 😉

### **Live Stream**

No live stream this week but I did send this tweet out that I would love your thoughts on.

## Upcoming Week

Now that our summer cohort students have graduated at [Tech Elevator](https://www.techelevator.com/) I think things should quiet down over the next month. I will be working on the 2 big articles I told you about earlier and trying to lock down a live streaming schedule.

PS - It's my birthday Wednesday so if you want to say hi on Twitter that would make an old man feel loved.
