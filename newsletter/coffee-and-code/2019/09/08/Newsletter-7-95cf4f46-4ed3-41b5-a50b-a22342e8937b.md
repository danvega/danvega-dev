Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega. This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it. 

## Previous Week

There isn't a whole lot to talk about as far as new content goes from me. I did want to share a couple of things with you that I hope you find exciting. 

First off if you're in the Cleveland area or know anyone who is and you're interested in working for an amazing company, [Tech Elevator is looking for another instructor](https://www.techelevator.com/become-an-instructor). I absolutely love Tech Elevator because every single person in the company cares about the students' outcome. If you have a passion for programming and want to help others this is a perfect opportunity for you.  

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is only a few weeks away and I want to make sure all of you sign up for it. Hacktoberfest is a great program that encourages more participation in the open-source community. If you can complete the 2019 challenge you will earn a limited edition t-shirt. I have to tell you that the shirts they give out every year are really awesome and I am hoping to get my hands on one of them this year. I might even set up some issues that I could use some help on in a few my projects so stay tuned. 

Finally, I have been working really hard on an article for the Vue community. This thing is massive and approaching 5,000 words but I imagine it will get cut down some. The only reason I am telling you about it is so that you don't think I am over here slacking on you guys. This is what has been taking up my time and I hope to have something to share with you soon.
