Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega. This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

This week was a busy week for me. I published a new blog article, a tutorial on YouTube, started my community on Discord and launched a back to school promotion for all of my courses on Udemy.

### Blog

This week I did something that I have been thinking about doing for a while now, start a Discord community. I [published an article](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2019/08/27/join-my-discord-community) this week that gives you a quick introduction to Discord, why I chose it as a platform and some details on how to [join my community](https://discord.gg/gx4Z8XY).

### YouTube

I also [published a new video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi4ZjqNcSQc) about Web Template Studio, which is a Visual Studio Code Extension. Web Template Studio (WebTS) is a user-friendly wizard to quickly bootstrap a web application. Best of all, Web Template Studio is open-source on GitHub.

I installed the extension for the first time and walked through bootstrapping a new web application using Vue + Express.

### Courses

I'm a life-long learner and it is something I really enjoy doing. Since you're a student here on Udemy I am guessing most of you are the same. I mean we pretty much have to be in the field that we are in right?

I got a chance to watch [@lizcodes](https://twitter.com/lizcodes) coding on her [live stream](https://www.twitch.tv/illuminatedspace) last week. She in the middle of building a project using Gatsby and React which I don't use at all but I found myself wanting to stick around. She is not only a super talented engineer but she just has a lot of fun writing code and talking to anyone in the room. If you haven't had a chance to check her out, do it now!
