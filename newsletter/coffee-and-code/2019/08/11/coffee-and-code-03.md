Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, [Dan Vega](https://www.danvega.dev/). This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

A couple of months ago I applied to become an author for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/) and this weekend I received the following email that I am so excited to share with you.

I have been a huge admirer of what freeCodeCamp does for our community and I can't wait to start contributing. A huge thanks to Quincy Larson for approving my application. Now the real question is what should my first article be about? If you have any thoughts please [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/therealdanvega).

### Blog

[Learn how to use CSS Grid with a FREE tool CSS Grid Generator](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2019/08/08/css-grid-generator)

As someone who has been developing web applications for almost 20 years now, I have seen it all. I started in FrontPage, moved to Dreamweaver, nested tables inside of tables and learned how to float and clear fix everything.

While you won't see any awards for my designs on my bookshelf I am able to create some very nice simple and clean layouts. That said I have never really enjoyed it because it has always been a huge pain in the a\$\$. I have always felt like I was just hacking away until my layout looked almost like what I had in mind.

This is why when tools like [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) & [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) came along I was beyond excited about the possibilities of creating clean layouts. I think if you combine these 2 technologies along with just how far JavaScript has come it is what has really got me excited about front end development these days.

While I have a pretty good understanding of CSS Grid at this point I know it can be a little bit confusing to get started. That is why I am really excited to share with you a new tool that I came across that I really think can help you out if you're trying to understand CSS Grid.

### YouTube

[Installing Java with SDKMan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vO8FTNyHww)

Nothing new this week in video format so I am pulling this one from my archives. One of my favorite tools around is called SDKMan. In this tutorial, I introduce you to SDKMan and how to use it.

### Learning

Listen, I realize that I have a problem and I'm ok with it. 🤷‍♂️ I love learning new things and when I found out about a new(ish) JavaScript framework for the server I just had to check it out. This week I finally had a chance to play around with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). While I didn't build anything that exciting I was able to produce a CRUD application that talked to a MongoDB database.

This might sound a little strange given the fact that they are not the same tech stacks but It felt a lot like using Spring Boot. I was able to get something done quickly and I feel like NestJS enables me to be a more productive developer. If you're interested in learning more about NestJS or have your opinions about it please reach out to me.
