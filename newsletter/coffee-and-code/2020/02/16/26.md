Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega for the week of Feb 9 - Feb 15, 2020.  This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you don't already have one grab a cup and your favorite beverage and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

This week I was able to publish a detailed article and video on `ref()` vs `reactive()` in Vue 3.

I think what I am most excited about Vue 3 is to see how other developers embrace it and use it. While I have had a chance to play with it over the last few months I know that isn't the case for everyone.

The biggest feature coming to Vue 3 is the Composition API. This offers an alternative approach to creating components that is much different than the existing options API. I have no problem admitting that when I first saw it, I didn't get it. The more I use it though the more it just makes sense. While you won't go rewriting entire applications using the Composition API it will make you think about how create components and compose functionality going forward.

I have [given a couple](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2020/01/09/codemash-2020/) of presentations on Vue 3 recently and one question that keeps coming up is when do I use Ref vs Reactive to declare a reactive property. I never had a great answer for this so over the past couple of weeks I set out to answer this question and this article is the result of that research.
