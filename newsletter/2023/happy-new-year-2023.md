Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of my newsletter. I want to start out by wishing you a Happy New Year. I hope your holidays were spent with family and friends and you were able to sneak in some rest, relaxation, learning, or all of the above. I have a couple of blog posts to share with you today and I‚Äôm preparing for a busy month of presentations.

## Reflections and Goals

I enjoy taking some time over the holidays to reflect on the previous year and think about what I want to focus on in the new year. I wrote 2 new blog posts that I hope you‚Äôll find interesting as you prepare for a new year.

## Presentations

### CodeMash

I am heading to [CodeMash](https://www.codemash.org/) next week to present, learn, and connect with the community. I am giving a talk on GraphQL in Java as well as an Introduction to Spring Workshop. This week will be spent fine-tuning those presentations and making sure I cover everything I want to talk about. I am beyond excited to see many friends I haven‚Äôt seen in a while as well and to connect with others in the community. If you are going to be there please make sure you stop me and say hi üëãüèª

### Cleveland Java User Group

If you can‚Äôt make it to CodeMash and you‚Äôre in the Cleveland area I will be giving my GraphQL talk in person on Tuesday, January 17th at Tech Elevator. The title of this talk is ‚ÄúGive your APIs a REST & Make the move to GraphQL‚Äù and here is a description of what I plan to cover.

_In a world where multiple applications and devices are calling your APIs, you end up having to create custom endpoints for different views of your data. What if you could provide fewer endpoints and let the consumer decide on which data they need? GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. In this session, you will learn the basic concepts of GraphQL. You will then learn how to use GraphQL in your Java applications with Spring for GraphQL. By the end of this presentation, you will be able to write and validate queries, create your own GraphQL API and write automated tests against them._

## Spring Boot 3

I am giving 3 presentations in January on Spring Boot 3. I believe 2 of them will be internal but the 3rd one should be public. That means as soon as I have a link to that presentation I will be sure to share it.

I have been having so much fun learning about all the new features in Spring Boot 3 and sharing what I have learned with the community. If you haven‚Äôt had a chance to check it out yet here is my video on What‚Äôs new in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3.

## Around the web

### üìù Articles

I really enjoyed this article on [How to create a Java Library from scratch to Maven Central](https://thegreatapi.com/blog/create-a-library-from-scratch/). This article walks you step by step through how to create a library and then publish it a library on Maven Central. If you have never gone through this process this is a great place to start.

### üé¨ Videos

I really enjoyed this video on [7 Awesome Libraries for Java Unit & Integration Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVPHSdHViMg) by Marco Behler. Marco produces some of the best content around and I really enjoy his video tutorials. In this one, Marco walks through 7 awesome libraries and explains what they are and when you would want to use them.

### üéô Podcasts

I have come to learn that not everyone knows about [A Bootiful Podcast](https://bootifulpodcast.fm/#/) with Josh Long. This is a podcast dedicated to the people behind Spring and its ecosystem. In this episode, Josh interviews [DaShaun Carter: an amazing human being, father, friend, engineer, and fellow Spring Developer Advocate](https://bootifulpodcast.fm/#/episodes/ee1262fe-d0a4-4d3b-9f8d-1e6510fedd1a). This episode not only featured 2 of my coworkers and friends but it was also a great conversation around Spring.
