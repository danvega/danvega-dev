Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. Today is Monday, June 19th, also known as Juneteenth, a day to celebrate freedom!

Tomorrow, I will be heading to KCDC, where I will deliver a 4-hour workshop on Getting Started with Spring and a breakout session on Spring Boot 3 and Beyond. If you're attending the conference, please say hello üëãüèª.

## HTTP Interface Clients

In last week's newsletter, I mentioned that I recently gave a presentation on Spring Boot 3. During that talk, I received some excellent questions about HTTP interfaces in Spring. This prompted me to do a deeper dive and answer those questions. From this effort, I was able to record, edit, and publish two videos on the topic last week.

Since then, I have received a significant number of questions, which tells me that you are very interested in the topic and how it works. I will do my best to answer them as they come in, but for now, enjoy these tutorials.

## NetNinja Series

I recently recorded a new series on how to build a portfolio site with Nuxt 3. I partnered with the NetNinja who has a really great YouTube channel and you can find the first video in that series below. This was an exciting project because you get to build a really cool portfolio using a variety of technologies like Nuxt 3, Vue 3, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL and Nuxt Content. I hope you enjoy this and I would love to hear what you think of it.

## Spring Office Hours

In this week's Spring Office Hours Podcast, DaShaun and I discussed a variety of topics, including a great discussion about virtual threads. I‚Äôm starting to get really excited about JDK 21 and Spring Framework 6.1 both of which will be released later this year.

## SpringOne at VMware Explore

Registration is now open for SpringOne at VMware explore. I invite you to join me at one of the best conferences of the year, where we'll discuss everything Spring.

I will be giving a talk on GraphQL and Spring Recipes with my friend Nate Schutta.

I really enjoyed [this article](https://spring.io/blog/2023/06/19/spring-boot-31-connectiondetails-abstraction) on Spring Boot 3.1‚Äôs ConnectionDetails abstraction.

### üé¨ Videos

I had a lot of fun listening to 2 of my friends chop it up on [Tales from the JAR Side with Nate Schutta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQJjRbS1pKI). I really enjoyed Ken digging into Nate‚Äôs story on speaking how he came up with his style of presentations.

### üéô Podcasts
