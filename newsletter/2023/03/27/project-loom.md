Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. If you're enjoying these conversations, please consider sharing [my newsletter](https://www.danvega.dev/newsletter/) with a friend.

In this edition of "Dan Rambles About What He's Been Up To," I want to talk about Project Loom, GraphQL Mutations, and a very special birthday.

## Project Loom & Virtual Threads

Last week, I spent a lot of time catching up on Project Loom and Virtual Threads. I wanted to give them a test drive in a Spring Boot application for a demo I am putting together. Before discussing the benefits of embracing virtual threads in a Spring application, it's important to provide some context about what they are and why they are needed.

I shared a graphic on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/therealdanvega/status/1638646601295044608) which, as of writing this newsletter, has over 55,000 views. This is amazing and indicates a high level of interest in this topic. Based on feedback, many people have questions about what Project Loom is and what problems it will solve for Spring developers. I hope to answer these and other questions in the near future.

If you have any questions about this, please feel free to reach out and let me know.

## GraphQL Mutations

If you follow me, you know I am a huge fan of GraphQL. If you're interested in getting started with GraphQL, I have a ton of resources on my blog and YouTube channel. However, I don't have much content on mutations in GraphQL, so I decided to change that.

If you aren't aware, there are three main operation types in GraphQL: query, mutation, and subscription. A mutation is used any time you want to change data, such as creating, updating, or deleting a record. In this tutorial, I will show you a few examples of how to create a new resource using a mutation. I will walk you through using simple scalar types, such as strings, a complex object type, and a way to bulk create using a List. I hope you enjoy this tutorial and if you had questions about mutations I hope I answered them.

## Happy Birthday Spring

It‚Äôs kind of hard to believe but The Spring Framework celebrated it‚Äôs 19th birthday last week. If you want you can read the blog post announcing [Spring Framework 1.0](https://spring.io/blog/2004/03/24/spring-framework-1-0-final-released) back on March 24, 2004.
