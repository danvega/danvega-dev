Happy Monday! Welcome to another week of me visiting your inbox for a few minutes. Last night was a thrilling Super Bowl, with Kansas City coming out on top üéâ I'm not a huge fan of the referees' decisions, but I won't blame the players for that. My biggest takeaway is the same one I have every year: when are we going to move the Super Bowl to Saturday night?

It's been two weeks since we last spoke, which is a reminder that we should make this a weekly event. In this edition, I want to discuss YouTube Shorts and Chat GPT, and I‚Äôll share with you a major milestone that I crossed yesterday.

I was disappointed to learn that I wasn't accepted to Devoxx UK or Devoxx France. Even though I know rejection is part of the process, it never gets any easier. I was really hoping to get an invitation to one of them, so I could make the trip across the pond. However, I'll try again next year. I still have CFPs out to many conferences, so let's cross our fingers ü§ûüèª and wish the conference committees luck in making their tough decisions.

In better news, we're less than a month away from March 12th - one of my favorite days of the year. It's Daylight Saving Time when we move our clocks forward an hour. January and February can be long, cold, depressing months here, so this is a welcome change. It means the days will be longer and we'll soon be through Winter. Plus, I can start running outside again as the weather warms up - I'm not a fan of running at 30¬∞F!

I hit a big milestone yesterday as I crossed 10,000 followers on the bird app. Thank you to everyone who follows me there and I hope I am providing value to your timeline.

I was really just excited about that milestone so I could share this ü§£

## Chat GPT

I worked on 2 new videos around Chat GPT. The first one was one that I was really excited to put together and I hope you enjoy watching as much fun as I had to put it together. In this tutorial, I built a CLI in Java called WTF GPT.

This application connects to the Open AI API (the same people behind Chat GPT) and responds to questions. I imagined it as a command line tool to help me remember commands I couldn't recall. Thanks to GraalVM, I was able to create a native image. Now, from the command line, I can type `wtfgpt What is the command to list all docker images` and get the correct response.

I recently worked on a video to demonstrate how Chat GPT can write a Spring Boot application. It was recorded and is awaiting editing and publication. I'm pleased with the outcome and believe it showcases some of the tasks Chat GPT excels at. Ultimately, I'm a big fan of Chat GPT and think it could be a great addition to any developer's toolkit.

## Spring Office Hours

In the latest edition of Spring Office Hours, we had a mailbag show where we planned to answer as many questions as possible. However, due to the high number of live questions, we didn't get to any of the mailbag questions. This is great news, as it shows that you enjoy these types of shows. Therefore, we will try to do them more often. In fact, the one we were supposed to do last week has been moved to [this week](http://www.springofficehours.io).

I created a few YouTube Shorts from this week's Spring Office Hours episode. I believe that taking a 1-minute clip of me answering a question is an excellent way to produce short-form content and provides me with an opportunity to repurpose content for YouTube Shorts.

Here are the 3 shorts I made from last week's episode:

- [Will virtual threads render WebFlux Obsolete?](https://youtube.com/shorts/JZu94r1CTYI?feature=share)
- [Spring RestTemplate vs WebClient vs Java HttpClient](https://youtube.com/shorts/vas12Uao1UQ?feature=share)
- [What does it take to become a Developer Advocate?](https://youtube.com/shorts/RW6DsRQV_4M?feature=share)

## Content

If you aren‚Äôt following me on Twitter or haven‚Äôt subscribed to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danvega) here is some of my latest content that you missed:

- [GraphQL Custom Scalars](https://youtu.be/ooknmgr4WiA) - Learn what the default scalars in GraphQL are defined by the specification and how you can use custom scalars in Spring for GraphQL.
- [My IntelliJ Setup](https://youtu.be/g78is10FjF0) - Everyone always asks me what theme I‚Äôm using in IntelliJ so I decided to go through and document my look and feel and some of my favorite features of IntelliJ.
- [Native Images in Java using GraalVM](https://youtu.be/Rk4zfvVvRks) - I took this opportunity to look at how GraalVM works when dealing with dynamic features of the JVM.

**Shorts**

- [Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) replace Software Developers](https://youtube.com/shorts/m3MkJQ_Hn0k?feature=share)

## Around the web

### üìù Articles

I was aware that YouTube Shorts was gaining traction, but I was surprised to learn that it had reached [50 billion daily views](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/03/google-says-youtube-shorts-has-crossed-50-billion-daily-views/). If you're interested in creating short-form content, now is a great time to get involved, as this impressive figure is only set to increase.

### üé¨ Videos

My friend and colleague Josh Long has been producing a lot of live streams on his [new channel](https://www.youtube.com/@coffeesoftware) recently. I particularly enjoyed his videos on integrating with the YouTube API, as I recently went through this process myself.
